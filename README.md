<h1>Pokemon Application</h1>
<p>This Next.js application demonstrates how to utilize the PokeAPI to implement search and filtering functionality. TypeScript is leveraged to enhance code quality and security. Additionally, Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the user interface in a responsive and visually appealing manner</p>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
